\chapter{ Future directions: toxin responses and metabolism }

\section{Toxins alter expression of many metabolic genes}
As discussed in a previous chapter, many genes encoding enzymes
for lipid and fatty acid pathways were differentially expressed
after toxin treatment. We therefore hypothesized that metabolism
of lipids and fats will alter the host responses to TcdA.
To test this, we placed mice on a high fat diet and performed
cecal injection experiments as described previously.
When the two factors were accounted for (western diet versus regular diet and
toxin-treated versus sham), there was no significant effects
caused by a high fat diet 16h after toxin injection (data not shown).
Nevertheless, many metabolic genes were altered. 
Since the greatest expression differences
occurred at 16 hours, it is possible that these changes
reflect upstream changes in central regulators known to
control the expression of many of these genes (e.g., nuclear receptors).

\section{Integrating and visualizing transcriptional changes within a metabolic network}
Since well-curated, genome-scale networks have been
constructed for human and mouse, it is possible to overlay
the transcriptional data in this dissertation onto these networks
to visualize modules or entire pathways that are altered.
In additon, the transcription may be used to turn enzymes on or
off in these models in order to determine shifts in metabolism
during pathogenesis or repair from TcdA and TcdB. 

Integration of transcription data with metabolic 
is therefore are a potential future direction that could
identify novel host responses to toxin. Although this dissertation
does not use metabolic models, I have had significant experience
with them while working with colleagues. In this chapter,
I present a review of methods for identifying drug targets
from metabolic reconstructions of microbes. However, the last
section is dedicated to how the host metabolism can controlled
or modified for new treatment strategies.

\section{Synopsis}
For many infectious diseases, novel treatment options are needed 
in order to address problems with cost, toxicity and resistance to 
current drugs. Systems biology tools can be used to gain valuable 
insight into pathogenic processes and aid in expediting drug discovery. 
In the past decade, constraint-based modeling of genome scale 
metabolic networks has become widely used. Focusing on pathogen 
metabolic networks, we review \gls{insilico} strategies used to identify 
effective drug targets and highlight recent successes as well as 
limitations associated with such computational analyses. We further 
discuss how accounting for the host environment and even targeting the 
host may offer new therapeutic options. These systems-level approaches 
are beginning to provide novel avenues for drug targeting against 
infectious agents.

\section{Systems biology and pathogen metabolism}
Systems biology methods have been applied extensively to the 
study of infectious diseases across multiple scales of 
biological organization to generate predictions ranging from pathogen 
gene lethality in particular microenvironments 
\cite{Jamshidi:2007ei,Fang:2010gc} to dynamics 
involved in the host immune response to infection \cite{SegoviaJuarez:2004bn}. Utilizing 
the predictive power of computational modeling and systems analysis, 
wideranging questions related to pathogen virulence, disease 
progression and host response can be explored to generate hypotheses 
for more thorough experimental investigation.

The increasing availability of high-quality genome-scale 
metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction}s \cite{Oberhardt:2009jw} presents an opportunity for the 
rational and systematic identification of metabolic drug 
targets in a pathogen of interest. Built bottom-up from functional 
genome annotations (and a variety of other data sources) and 
analyzed with computational methods such as \gls{fba}, these biochemical networks can account 
for hundreds to thousands of metabolites participating in enzymatic 
reactions across a range of metabolic subsystems (e.g.\ carbohydrate, 
amino acid, lipid, nucleotide and energy metabolism) and cellular 
localizations (e.g.\ extracellular space, cytosol and compartments 
specific to particular organisms) (\autoref{trends:fig1}A) \cite{Thiele:2010fr}. Since the 
initial genome-scale \glssymbol{reconstruction}s of \textit{Escherichia coli} \cite{Edwards:2000cn,Reed:2003bj} 
and Haemophilus influenzae \cite{Edwards:1999ix,Schilling:2000ig}, the metabolic networks of over 
50 organisms (bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes) have been 
reconstructed (reviewed in \cite{Oberhardt:2009jw}). Elements of this network 
\glssymbol{reconstruction} process have been automated, allowing the preliminary 
analysis of hundreds of draft network \glssymbol{reconstruction}s \cite{Henry:2010dg}. Among 
these, metabolic networks have been reconstructed for several pathogenic 
organisms (\autoref{trends:table1}). Indeed, the study of pathogen metabolism-for the 
elucidation of highpriority drug targets and metabolic factors 
contributing to pathogenicity—is an exciting application for 
metabolic network modeling and systems biology.

       \textbf{(A)} A 
       functionally annotated genome together with data from the 
       biochemical literature are used to assemble a network 
       \glssymbol{reconstruction}. \gls{fba} allows for 
       modeling and simulation of the reconstructed network. 
       Advanced network analyses (such as gene essentiality or 
       \glssymbol{fva}) allow for identifying potential 
       antimicrobial drug targets. These targets can then be 
       associated with drugs using bioinformatics approaches 
       and obtaining target drug information from a variety 
       of publicly available databases (e.g.\ STITCH or DrugBank). 
       Predictions involving targets and drugs can be experimentally 
       validated. Any discrepancies between computational

In this review, we explore several techniques and approaches 
used to predict antimicrobial drug targets from metabolic network 
modeling using \gls{fba}. Where possible we present examples that have 
led to novel data, drug targets, or drugs. Metabolic network 
modeling is still in its infancy, but has allowed for predictions 
that align with previous data and has provided many hypotheses 
that continue to be developed. We first discuss the fundamental 
aspects of network analysis and \gls{fba} in particular. Subsequently, 
we delve into how computational metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction}s can be 
used to prioritize drug target predictions. Furthermore, we 
review recent developments on model-guided pipelines for drug 
target discovery against pathogens. Finally, we extend the discussion 
to include host cell metabolism and propose directions for future 
modeling efforts in infectious disease.

\section[Reconstructing metabolic networks]{Reconstructing the metabolic network and defining an objective}

A \gls{reconstruction} is assembled piece-by-piece 
by compiling data on known enzymes, genes encoding these enzymes, 
and the stoichiometry of the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes 
(see \cite{Durot:2009kb} for a list of databases containing such data). \glspl{gpr}, 
in the form of Boolean logic statements, define 
which genes are necessary for each enzyme and which enzymes are 
necessary for each reaction \cite{Thiele:2010fr} (\autoref{trends:fig1}B). The information for 
all the reactions in a network \glssymbol{reconstruction} with m metabolites 
and n reactions can be stored in an m by n table or matrix, the 
\gls{smatrix}. Each element or cell in this matrix 
corresponds to the stoichiometric coefficient of one particular 
metabolite in one particular reaction \cite{Thiele:2010fr,Lee:2006je}. The \gls{smatrix} enables 
strict accounting for the underlying biochemistry and allows a 
quantitative description of complex interactions between metabolites 
that are responsible for driving a cellular phenotype. This matrix 
formalism facilitates interrogation of the structural and functional 
properties of the network.

The application of \gls{fba} to a network \glssymbol{reconstruction} results in the 
identification of combinations of reaction \glspl{flux} that correspond 
to a maximum \gls{flux} through a targeted reaction (an \glssymbol{objectivereaction}) while 
requiring that constraints are satisfied, for example that the 
mass entering the network is equal to the mass exiting the network (\gls{massbalance}). 
In more mathematical terms, \gls{fba} involves the use of a 
\gls{linearprogramming} formulation wherein an objective is optimized subject 
to a set of governing constraints (\hyperref[trends:box:fba]{Box \ref{trends:box:fba}}) 
\cite{Oberhardt:2009jw,Lee:2006je,Gianchandani:2010gs}. In addition 
to requiring \gls{massbalance} for every reaction, thermodynamic, 
topological, environmental, and regulatory data may provide 
additional constraints that dictate the \gls{fluxspace} \cite{Price:2004hx}. 
An \glssymbol{objectivereaction} often used with \gls{fba} is \glssymbol{biomass} production, which is 
represented \gls{insilico} as a drain capturing crucial metabolites 
necessary for growth of the organism \cite{Feist:2010hq,Varma:1993hd}. With the ultimate 
goal of identifying antimicrobial drug targets (and associated 
drugs) to slow or stop the growth of a pathogen, a \glssymbol{biomass} objective
is often very appropriate for computational modeling efforts. 
Network \glssymbol{reconstruction}s of most pathogenic organisms have incorporated 
\glspl{biomass} as their \glssymbol{objectivereaction}s (\autoref{trends:table1}).

\input{trends/box1}

The inability of the metabolic network model to synthesize even one 
metabolite of the \gls{biomass} will result in a predicted value 
of zero for the \gls{objectiveflux} (\glssymbol{biomass}), and analogously no growth. 
Therefore, growth predictions are sensitive to metabolites that are 
placed in the \gls{biomass} reaction. \gls{fba} can be used to investigate the 
ability of the model to produce each metabolite within \glssymbol{biomass}. In 
the \textit{Porphyromonas gingivalis} metabolic network, the ability of the 
model to produce each of the 52 metabolites within the \gls{biomass} 
was evaluated after systematic reaction deletions \cite{Mazumdar:2009gj}. 
Crucial groups of reactions were identified that were responsible for 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, coenzyme A production, glycolysis, 
or purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis \cite{Mazumdar:2009gj}. Corresponding enzymes that 
are essential for growth, as well as for the production of important 
bacterial components such as LPS, could serve as potential drug 
targets. In addition, in a study of \textit{Leishmania major} metabolism, 
the contribution of minimal media components to the synthesis of 
individual \gls{biomass} constituents was analyzed \cite{Chavali:2008gh}. The study found 
that the absence of cysteine and oxygen in the minimal media had a 
drastic impact on the overall metabolic network, limiting the 
generation of 30 of the 40 \glssymbol{biomass} constituents \cite{Chavali:2008gh}. Network analyses 
as delineated in these examples of \textit{P. gingivalis} and \textit{L. major} may 
permit the formulation of a hypothesis for the role of specific 
metabolites and their influence on growth. Therefore, defining an 
appropriate \gls{biomass} (\hyperref[trends:box:objective]{Box \ref{trends:box:objective}} and
\hyperref[trends:box:caveats]{Box \ref{trends:box:caveats}}) is crucial for useful 
predictions and identification of vulnerable parts of the metabolism 
of a pathogen.

\section[Drug targets in metabolic networks]{The quest for drug targets in metabolic networks of pathogens}

\subsubsection{Gene essentiality analysis}
The most common method to identify potential drug targets has been 
through the prediction of essential genes (\autoref{trends:table1}). The enzymes 
encoded by essential genes are typically hypothesized as drug targets. 
Gene knockouts might lead to a redistribution of \gls{flux} through the 
network if the perturbed gene or gene product affects the removal 
of a particular \gls{flux}-carrying reaction \cite{Oberhardt:2009jw}. A \gls{gpr} aids in mapping 
the effects of a genetic (or pharmacological) perturbation on the 
associated reactions, and thus the network. Gene-level perturbations 
that result in reduced or zero \gls{flux} through a \gls{biomass} 
correspond to growth-reducing or lethal gene knockouts, 
respectively (\autoref{trends:fig2}). For example, in a \glssymbol{reconstruction} of 
\textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}, five previously known drug targets 
were encoded by genes predicted to be essential from computational 
analysis \cite{Beste:2007bi}. For metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction}s of pathogens, 
enzymes that are predicted to be essential will offer new 
experimental hypotheses and avenues for drug discovery. In the 
following subsections we discuss several other approaches for 
drug targeting using metabolic network analysis. These other 
approaches may provide a separate list of potential 
targets; however, they can also be used in tandem with 
gene essentiality analysis for step-by-step prioritization 
of drug targets.

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \includegraphics[width=1.05\textwidth]{trends/Figure2}
  \caption[Drug targeting in metabolic networks]{
       \textbf{Drug targeting in metabolic networks.}
       Various strategies are illustrated for identifying drug 
       targets by performing \gls{fba} on metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction}s. 
       The sample network shows an input media that represents 
       the environment and \glspl{exchangereaction}, intracellular 
       reactions, and an \gls{objectivereaction} that drains metabolites 
       out of the system. An essential reaction and metabolite 
       that, when removed, block any \gls{flux} through the \glssymbol{objectivereaction} 
       are highlighted in red. In the conditionally essential 
       panel, the absence of the metabolite highlighted in blue 
       causes the highlighted reaction to become essential in 
       the selected media. One of the synthetic lethal pairs 
       of the network is denoted by `SL'. The dashed line in 
       the \glssymbol{fva} illustration may represent `near-optimal'
       \gls{objectiveflux}. A robust reaction maintains near-optimal 
       \gls{objectiveflux} over a larger range of reaction \glspl{flux}.
  }
  \label{trends:fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Enzyme robustness and flux variability}
In addition to an analysis of gene essentiality, assessing enzyme 
robustness could identify vulnerable or sensitive portions of a 
metabolic network suitable for drug targeting. To determine the 
robustness of a metabolic network to the inhibition of an 
enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the \gls{flux} of a reaction may be constrained 
to a fraction of its wild type \gls{flux} (simulating partial to 
complete inhibition), and the effects on an \gls{objectiveflux} 
(e.g.\ \glssymbol{biomass} production) can be evaluated \cite{Edwards:2000cz} (\autoref{trends:fig2}). 
Such an approach was used in analyzing the network \glssymbol{reconstruction} 
of \textit{Francisella tularensis}, which revealed that the growth rate 
was sensitive to changes in \ce{H+} and \ce{NH4} \gls{flux} in a simulated in vitro 
medium but not in a simulated in vivo medium that mimicked the 
environment during infection \cite{Raghunathan:2010gl}. Analyzing enzyme robustness with 
different constraints provides a detailed view of possibly nonlethal 
reactions whose change in \gls{flux} has a strong effect on the \glssymbol{objectivereaction} 
of a network under different environmental conditions, therefore 
suggesting important reactions during an infection or perturbations 
for drug targeting.

Alternatively, the \glssymbol{objectivereaction} function could be constrained to a fixed 
percentage of its wild type \gls{flux} and the allowable range of \gls{flux} 
for each reaction can be determined using an approach termed 
\gls{fva} (\hyperref[trends:box:fva]{Box \ref{trends:box:fva}}) \cite{Mahadevan:2003di}. A recognized shortcoming 
of \gls{fba} is that the typical implementation calculates only one 
of many possible solutions that optimize \gls{flux} through the 
\gls{objectivereaction}. Consequently, there may be many possible routes through 
the network that achieve the same optimal \gls{flux} for a given 
\glssymbol{objectivereaction} \cite{Price:2004hx,Mahadevan:2003di}. 
In an effort to circumvent this shortcoming, 
FVA was developed to determine the range of \glspl{flux} over which 
a particular reaction operates, while still allowing for 
optimal, or near-optimal, \gls{objectiveflux} \cite{Mahadevan:2003di}. FVA also identifies 
blocked reactions (reactions incapable of carrying any \gls{flux} in 
a given model under specified constraints) or reactions with 
different \gls{flux} ranges in various media. Enzymes that catalyze 
reactions with little to no variability in \gls{flux} for a given 
\glssymbol{objectivereaction} could be selected as potential drug targets given that 
the network may be sensitive to even modest inhibition of its 
activity. In analyzing the \glssymbol{reconstruction} of \textit{M. tuberculosis}, the 
average of the highest and lowest allowable \gls{flux} for each reaction 
was used as a point of comparison for the model under constraints 
for two growth rates \cite{Beste:2007bi}. In the study, the reaction catalyzed by 
isocitrate lyase---an enzyme important for persistence in a 
host---was predicted to have increased \gls{flux} during slow growth, 
and the activity of the enzyme was experimentally confirmed to 
be greater in slow-growing cells of the closely related 
\textit{Mycobacterium bovis} \cite{Beste:2007bi}. Hence, \glssymbol{fva} and enzyme 
robustness aid in further prioritizing drug targets identified 
from other methods such as gene essentiality.

\input{trends/box4}

\subsection{Metabolite essentiality}
Many current drugs have high similarity to natural metabolites and 
compete for and/or inhibit normal enzymatic activity \cite{Dobson:2009kg}. Therefore, 
another very interesting avenue towards identifying drug targets 
in metabolic networks is via the prediction of essential metabolites. 
In contrast to the more traditional individual gene knockouts 
mentioned previously, metabolites in the \gls{smatrix} can also be 
systematically removed. Consequently, all reactions in which a 
given metabolite participates are removed, and the resultant 
effects on the \glssymbol{objectivereaction} are assessed (\autoref{trends:fig2}). A total of 
211 essential metabolites in the \textit{Acinetobacter baumanii} 
\glssymbol{reconstruction} were narrowed to 9 following removal of (i) currency 
metabolites (ATP, NADH, \ce{H2O}, etc.); (ii) metabolites present in 
the human metabolic network; and (iii) metabolites participating 
in reactions catalyzed by enzymes with human homologs \cite{Kim:2010cu}. 
Enzymes that catalyze reactions involved in the consumption or 
production of these essential metabolites may be considered 
as drug targets. Moreover, structural analogs of essential 
metabolites may be considered as test compounds for experimental 
evaluation, thus sidestepping extensive screening or 
computational predictions \cite{Kim:2011jm}.

\subsection{Combination gene and reaction perturbations}
Many anti-infectives on the market act on multiple targets. 
This multiplicity of targets was exemplified in a network 
analysis of 890 FDA-approved drugs targeting 394 human 
proteins (derived from the DrugBank database), where 
approximately 38\% of the drugs were associated with more 
than one protein target, and a few drugs were associated 
with as many as 14 targets \cite{Yildirim:2007hc}. In that regard, a drug 
discovery strategy incorporating compounds known to act 
simultaneously on multiple targets can be adopted for 
microbial pathogens. \gls{fba} allows predictions involving 
the perturbation of multiple genes or reactions in a rapid 
timeframe (minutes or hours)—a single \gls{insilico} combination 
taking only a fraction of a second \cite{Becker:2007cu}. In a \glssymbol{reconstruction} 
of \textit{M. tuberculosis} that accounted for features specific to 
an in vivo environment, all non-trivial double-deletion 
mutants (synthetic lethal pairs) were tested for \gls{insilico} 
growth using \gls{fba} \cite{Fang:2010gc}. Of two experimentally-characterized 
double gene deletions, the model accurately predicted reduced 
\gls{insilico} growth in both in vitro and in vivo environmental 
conditions \cite{Fang:2010gc}. A combination of drugs that affect synthetic 
lethal targets may act synergistically to inhibit growth of 
a pathogen, thereby paving the way for model-guided predictions 
of drug synergy. Experimentally screening for all possible 
drug combinations against a particular pathogen is costly 
and is often not feasible. Therefore, predicted combinations 
of drugs associated with synthetic lethal targets can direct 
more specific experiments and perhaps reveal entirely novel 
treatment strategies.

\subsection{Groups of targets and network topology}
Other approaches characterizing the structure of a genome-scale 
network \glssymbol{reconstruction} identify sets of reactions that act 
together and therefore may be targeted as an entire pathway. 
Sets of correlated reactions (or Co-sets) consist of groups 
of reactions whose \glspl{flux} are linked, and which represent 
functional modules within a biochemical network \cite{Papin:2004eh}. Co-sets, 
which can aid in suggesting alternative drug targets by 
identifying reactions that are functionally related to each 
other, can be divided into several categories. A perfect 
Co-set consists of a group of reactions such that, for any 
given pair in the group, a non-zero \gls{flux} in one reaction 
implies a non-zero \gls{flux} in the other, with a fixed ratio . 
Other categories include partial Co-sets (pairs of linked 
reactions, but with a variable \gls{flux} ratio) and directional 
Co-sets (a non-zero \gls{flux} in one reaction implies a nonzero 
\gls{flux} in the other, but the converse is not true) \cite{Xi:2011gc}. By 
calculating hard-coupled reaction (HCR) sets---a subgroup 
of perfect Co-sets where sets of reactions are defined by 
participating metabolites sharing a consumption to production 
connectivity of 1:1 (i.e. two reactions are linked by a 
metabolite that is connected to no other reaction)---one study 
found 25 of 147 HCR sets contained previously identified drug targets 
in \textit{M. tuberculosis} \cite{Jamshidi:2007ei}. Because an altered \gls{flux} in one reaction 
results in an altered \gls{flux} of all reactions within a HCR set, only 
one enzyme needs to be targeted. This approach aids in prioritizing 
the list of potential drug targets by identifying linked enzymatic 
reactions. Hence, analyses of the topology of a metabolic network 
can reveal key local and structural features that may be important 
drug targets when data related to environment \glspl{flux} or appropriate 
\glssymbol{objectivereaction} are not necessarily available.

\subsection{Environment and conditional essentiality}
Finally, the metabolic phenotype is dependent on the media 
environment and the exchange of metabolites into and out of 
the system (see \hyperref[trends:box:caveats]{Box \ref{trends:box:caveats}} 
for discussion of knowledge gaps 
associated with nutrient availability). By constraining uptake 
or secretion \glspl{flux}, a minimal set of metabolites that allows 
\gls{flux} through the \glssymbol{objectivereaction} 
can be computed \cite{Chavali:2008gh}. Moreover, 
enzymes or metabolites that are necessary for growth in 
various environments (e.g.\ minimal media, defined media, 
or rich media with an abundance of nutrients and carbon sources) 
can be predicted. In the \glssymbol{reconstruction} of \textit{F. tularensis}, 
genes that were essential in a simulated macrophage environment 
and five other environmental conditions were considered to be 
unconditionally essential genes (in other words, they 
represented a core set of genes that were essential regardless 
of the medium). Of the 17 virulence factors cataloged from 
previous literature, eight were unconditionally essential 
genes \cite{Raghunathan:2010gl}. By contrast, enzymes that may be necessary for 
growth under one condition, but not another, are conditionally 
essential (\autoref{trends:fig2}). With a careful consideration of an \glssymbol{objectivereaction}
and appropriate nutrient uptake, gene essentiality analysis may 
reveal new drug targets specific to particular growth conditions 
and environments in which a pathogen must survive. Such an 
analysis can also inform strategies for manipulating the 
environment of the pathogen that could be effective as a 
treatment option.

\section{From target to drug and the development of 
         model guided pipelines for drug discovery}
Computational analysis of metabolic processes in pathogens can 
yield a ranking of predicted drug targets. Bioinformatics and 
network analyses were performed to yield a high-confidence list 
of targets against \textit{M. tuberculosis} \cite{Raman:2008km}. By implementing a 
multilayered approach, targets that did not pass sequential 
cut-off values were removed (e.g.\ elimination of enzymes with 
human homologs or targets with no computationally predicted 
binding pocket) \cite{Raman:2008km}. In another proof-of-concept study it 
was noted that essential type II fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS II) 
reactions in the \textit{E. coli} MG1655 metabolic network were also 
essential in several \textit{Staphylococcus aureus} strains \cite{Shen:2010cy}. Following 
network analysis, a virtual screening strategy was employed 
whereby small molecules from a library of approximately 106 
compounds were docked to enzymes catalyzing essential reactions, 
and 41 inhibitors of FAS II enzymes were selected for experimental 
validation \cite{Shen:2010cy}. In cell viability assays, six of the inhibitors 
had growth-retarding effects against \textit{E. coli} and \textit{S. aureus} 
strains in standard LB agar plates \cite{Shen:2010cy}. Finally, following 
the identification of 163 essential metabolites, a third study 
used a layered approach to prioritize five essential metabolites 
in the metabolic network of the opportunistic pathogen 
\textit{Vibrio vulnificus} \cite{Kim:2011jm}. Currency metabolites, metabolites consumed by 
a single reaction, metabolites present in the human metabolic 
network, and metabolites associated with enzymes with human 
homologs were removed. The study screened 352 compounds found 
to be structurally similar to one of the five essential metabolites 
and identified one compound that most potently inhibited growth, 
more so than a currently used drug \cite{Kim:2011jm}. These studies provide 
various examples of model-guided pipelines to drug discovery by 
primarily using network analyses to identify and prioritize drug 
targets. Additional constraints such as enzyme druggability and 
elevated gene expression can also be used to prioritize drug 
targets, which can then guide the screening and selection of compounds.

A common approach in proposing drug targets using metabolic 
networks has been to rule out targets that overlap with host 
cell metabolism---the idea being that offtargets can be minimized 
and drug interference plus subsequent complications with the host 
can be avoided. However, there are arguments to be made in favor 
of retaining targets that overlap with human metabolism. First, 
accounting for the drug selectivity between host and pathogen 
targets at the respective binding sites may preclude off-target 
influences \cite{Hopkins:2008bb}. Second, if the goal is to discover drugs against 
infectious diseases quickly, then the best option may be to 
focus on finding new clinical indications for existing FDA-approved 
drugs (i.e. pursuing drug repurposing strategies) instead of 
developing new investigational compounds that are subject to 
regulatory hurdles \cite{Chong:2007dl}. Also, the majority of FDA-approved 
drugs target human proteins. Hence, eliminating pathogen 
targets that overlap with human proteins reduces the number 
of potential drugs that could be evaluated experimentally.

\section{A host cell perspective}
Interaction with a host cell is often crucial to the metabolism 
and survival of a pathogen. For instance, the kinetoplastid 
parasite \textit{L. major} is unable to synthesize several essential 
amino acids and therefore obtains them from the host macrophage \cite{McConville:2007df}. 
As another example, Legionella pneumophila, the bacterium 
responsible for Legionnaire's disease, ceases to replicate 
inside a host macrophage when it cannot access or process 
threonine \cite{Sauer:2005kf}. Consequently, identifying the particular 
niche of nutrients and resources in the host cell required 
by a pathogen is vital to discovering treatment options 
that specifically target host-pathogen interactions \cite{Brown:2008gm}.

A systems-level analysis of pathogen metabolism interfaced 
with cell type-specific host metabolic networks can also 
be conducted. Because \textit{P. falciparum} invades mature erythrocytes 
to establish infection in its human host, a metabolic model 
of the human erythrocyte was built in conjunction with the 
\textit{P. falciparum} \glssymbol{reconstruction} to make predictions which aligned 
closer to known conditions in the infected erythrocyte \cite{Huthmacher:2010hi}. 
This model, modifying an existing approach from Shlomi et al. \cite{Shlomi:2008ik}, 
integrated previous gene expression data where several enzymes 
were constrained to be 'on' and 'off' during specific life-cycle 
stages. The combined erythrocyte-blood stage \textit{P. falciparum} 
network correctly predicted metabolite exchanges between the 
microbe and host \cite{Huthmacher:2010hi}. A recently active area of research has 
been the development of algorithms to create cell type-specific 
metabolic networks by integrating gene and protein expression 
data with existing human metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction}s 
\cite{Shlomi:2008ik,Becker:2008iq,Jensen:2011ie}. Inclusion 
of host-specific factors into pathogen metabolic-network 
\glssymbol{reconstruction}s or developing systems-level models of host and 
pathogen networks will continue to enable investigations into 
the complexities of the host-pathogen interplay.

Finally, inhibiting host pathways and perturbing the \gls{flux} of 
metabolites in the host cell may alter the ambient environment 
and require pathogens to adapt their metabolic needs. Therefore, 
targeting the machinery of a host cell at the host-pathogen 
interface can provide new therapeutic 
approaches \cite{Schwegmann:2008iq}. For 
example, host proteins hijacked for viral replication are 
potentially important drug targets. Recently, a high-throughput 
screening assay identified a lipophilic compound--NA255--that 
inhibits the host serine palmitoyltransferase, an enzyme 
needed for association of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with host 
lipid rafts \cite{Sakamoto:2005bd}. Moreover, to characterize transformations 
in host functions, data specific to the host cell preand 
post-infection must be obtained. The analysis of transcription 
profiles is one approach that has been successfully implemented 
to identify genes in the host cell that are differentially 
regulated due to pathogenic infection \cite{Handley:2006fc,Hossain:2006gl}. Similarly, 
profiling the proteome and lipidome of a hepatocyte over 
the time-course of infection and integrating these data with 
protein-protein interaction networks revealed multiple 
lipids and enzymes differentially regulated in HCV-infected 
cells \cite{Diamond:2010it}. A third approach for identifying factors in the 
host necessary for establishing infection involves the use 
of genetic screens in which largescale insertional mutagenesis 
is performed to develop null mutants in a human cell line \cite{Carette:2009ba}. 
Ultimately, the use of new experimental technologies along 
with metabolic modeling will be vital to discovering host 
components crucial to the survival of a pathogen.

\section{Next steps}

Advanced meta-network analyses, such as comparative modeling 
of metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction}s across multiple strains and 
species or community-based modeling of metabolism across 
differing pathogenic organisms, have broad implications 
for understanding and investigating infectious diseases. 
Below, we highlight several future directions in this 
realm and provide a few examples of efforts already underway.

The recent completion of metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction}s of the 
pathogen \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa} \cite{Oberhardt:2008fr} and the related nonpathogen 
\textit{Pseudomonas putida} \cite{Puchalka:2008ct} creates new opportunities for 
investigating species-specific differences in metabolism 
and the metabolic basis for virulence of \textit{P. aeruginosa}. 
Towards that end, a reconciliation of the two \glssymbol{reconstruction}s 
was completed such that any differences in the metabolic 
networks of \textit{P. aeruginosa} and \textit{P. putida} would be indicative 
of true biological variations as opposed to artifacts of 
the \glssymbol{reconstruction} and modeling process \cite{Oberhardt:2011jq}. In the reconciliation 
study, the model for each organism was analyzed to characterize 
the tradeoffs of producing \glssymbol{biomass} versus the production of 
individual metabolites. Compared to \textit{P. putida}, \textit{P. aeruginosa} 
was able to produce a small proportion of the shared virulence 
factor precursors with only a slight decrease in \glssymbol{biomass} 
production. In general, the metabolic flexibility analysis 
suggested that the virulence of \textit{P. aeruginosa} is complex 
and highly multifactorial, and has more flexibility than 
\textit{P. putida} in many metabolic pathways. This computational 
analysis paves the way for future modeling efforts of other 
infectious disease-causing agents and their basis for establishing 
virulence.

As another example, syntrophic mutualism between a sulfate-reducing 
bacterium, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, and a methanogen, \textit{Methanococcus 
maripaludis}, was investigated by performing \gls{fba} on a compartment-based 
model involving the metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction}s of both organisms 
and a culture medium \cite{Stolyar:2007jh}. In another study, gene expression data 
were integrated with the genome-scale metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction} of 
\textit{P. aeruginosa} in the context of a chronic cystic fibrosis lung 
infection over a 44-month time-course \cite{Oberhardt:2010bp}. This analysis provided 
a systems-level view of bacterial adaptations in a cystic fibrotic 
lung environment over time. Subsequent studies can shed light on 
the interactions between multiple organisms over the time course 
of an infection.

Finally, automated \glssymbol{reconstruction} platforms such as ModelSEED 
permit the rapid \glssymbol{reconstruction} of hundreds of draft bacterial 
metabolic networks \cite{Overbeek:2005dv,Aziz:2008ku}. Integration of many such reconstructed 
networks may help elucidate interactions within the host 
microbiome and partially explain the development of opportunistic 
infections that occur primarily because of an altered bacterial 
flora and environment. For example, an integrative metabolic 
analysis of organisms in the human gut microbiome could aid 
understanding of the intricate balance between non-pathogenic 
and potentially pathogenic organisms during healthy and 
infectious states in the gastrointestinal tract. An expected 
outcome of such analyses could result in the selection of 
drugs or drug cocktails that specifically target pathogens 
without eliminating non-pathogenic members.

\section{Concluding remarks}
As \glssymbol{reconstruction}s of metabolic networks become more standard 
and automated \cite{Thiele:2010fr}, the need for computational tools to characterize 
these networks becomes more apparent. In addition, the generation 
and management of large datasets pertaining to both host cell 
and pathogen intracellular processes of metabolism, signal 
transduction or regulation has necessitated a systems approach 
and, therefore, the computational methods used to analyze 
these data are becoming increasingly important. 
Experimental methods will continue to improve, thereby 
generating data that have so far been either impossible 
or prohibitively laborious to obtain, and which have 
constrained the value of some model predictions. For 
example, TraDIS (a new experimental method used to 
identify all essential genes simultaneously) directly 
measures gene essentiality that the model could only 
predict \cite{Langridge:2009ip}. However, the iterative relationship between 
modeling and experiment will always permit the generation 
of novel hypotheses and the contextualization of large 
datasets, often in a quicker and more cost-efficient 
manner (e.g.\ rapid essentiality prediction of all double 
gene knockouts). Network-based approaches such as 
genome-scale metabolic \glssymbol{reconstruction}s have been effective 
in drug target prediction and will continue to expand 
in scope and applicability. In addition, integration 
of networks and data into more standard pipelines that 
traverse the spectrum from computational prediction to 
experimental evaluation and back again will speed the 
process dramatically. By including many types of data 
sources that have yet to be coupled, entirely new classes 
of drug targets or treatment strategies may be found. The 
already enormous amount of data is only increasing, and the 
use of systems biology approaches will be vital to driving 
future research of drug and drug target discovery against 
infectious diseases.
