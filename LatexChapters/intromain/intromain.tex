\section{Abstract}

\section{A preview of this dissertation}

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{ Background of C. difficile }
Cdiff is bad
\subsubsection{ Background of transcriptomics research }
Analyses are hard

\subsection{JTM paper}
Example of transcriptomics
\subsection{ Linker is to go from individual genes to pathways and functions }

\subsection{BMC paper}
Lots of changes in cells
\subsection{Linker is going towards in vivo}
Make sure to show the unpublished results from Ki-67 and other pictures
Mention that there are better methods to look at this, Fucci mice
No one has ever considered how growth is regulated over long term by
low toxin concentrations in long-lasting infections.

\section{INI paper}
Many variables. Many changes. Markers of disease severity.

\subsection{Linker. Quantification of toxin}
Make sure to show the pictures of cells and the quantification of toxin.

\subsection{Linker. The effects of other cell types}

\section{Impedance paper}
These are the different cell types

\subsection{Metabolic changes are big}
Repeat some of the findings with the in vivo arrays.
Show the western diet and results.

\subsection{Linker}
Discuss future directions with metabolism and inflammation.

\section{Trends Review}


\section{Concluding remarks and final thoughts}
Discuss how we may not be studying the specific response to toxin,
yet a general host response to acute inflammation. This is good and 
bad. Work can be extended to other toxins and causes of
diarrhea and inflammation.
